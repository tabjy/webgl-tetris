# WebGL Tetris!

## What is this?

First assignment of a computer graphics course. The topic of the assignment is fundamental and fun.

If you are doing a similar assignment for academic purposes and studying my source code, please be sure to acknowledge. This is most likely required to protect your academic integrity. For all other situations, [MIT license](LICENSE) applies.

## Get Started

**Opening `index.html` directly from file system will *NOT* work!**

This assignment is tested on Google Chrome 72.0.3626.81 and Firefox 65.0. Theretically, the assignment works on all modern browsers, but try not to grade this on IE. Webpack is used to package and transpile JavaScript source code as manually manage and integrate over ten source modules can be problematic. In addition, shader sources are loaded asynchronously with `window.fetch()` function, which requires remote resources being hosted on an HTTP server. To correctly open this assignment, follow the instruction below.

### Online Demo

Simply visit [http://tetris.tabjy.com](http://tetris.tabjy.com).

### Build from Source

Alternatively, you can build from source. This requires you to have `node` and `npm` installed.

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

Then, please set up a simple HTTP server on localhost:

```
$ cd dist
$ python3 -m http.server
```

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Or, run

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

to start a Webpack local development server on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

If you have any problem with running my assignment, please submit an issue.

## Features

### Required Features

All features documented in assignment description, namely,
- tile and grid rendering and tile downward movement
- tile stack-up
- key stroke interaction and tile movements
- additional game logic

### Extra features/works

In addition to required features, efforts are put into followings,
- an Unity3D-like scripting runtime API, with classes `AssetManager`, `Behavior`, `Color`, `Component`, `Game`, `GameObject`, `Mesh`, `Renderer`, `Transform`, and `Vector2`, located under `src/runtime`.
	- `AssetManager`: loads remote assets asynchronously
	- `GameObject`:  servers multiple purposes by attaching with different `Component` classes, which inherent from:
		- `Behavior`: provides `onStart`, `onUpdate`, `onLateUpdate`, `onFixedUpdate` scripting interfaces
		- `Mesh`: defines vertices and faces for that will be passed to shaders, converts local `Transforms` to WebGL clip coordinates
		- `Renderer`: takes vertices positions from a `Mesh` and populate WebGL buffers, executes shaders
		- `Transform`: defines relative transformation to its parent, supports position, scaling, the rotation, `GameObject`s with their transforms being decedents of `Game.world.transform` would be rendered.
	- `Color`: defines an `RGBA` color.
	- `Vector2`: represents a 2D vector with algebra functions.
	- This runtime is theoretically sufficient for any 2D presentation.
- an FPS counter
- display of current game information:
	- game state: `GameLogic.STATES.READY`, `GameLogic.STATES.PLAYING`, or `GameLogic.STATES.GAME_OVER`
	- preview of next tile, and the name
- scores: current and high score
- alternative tile falling mode: discrete or continuous
- adjustable falling velocity
- a button to start/restart the game

## 3rd-Party Codes

All 3rd-part codes are development-dependencies, and mostly used for Webpack packaging/integration. No 3rd-party codes are required at run time. No 3rd-part code is related to rendering, 2D transformations, linear algebra, or game logic. For a comprehensive list of these modules, please see `package.json`.

**I claim full ownership of all code that's running while grading.**
